# RESUME WEB PAGE

Im just trying to get employers to see my profile in linkedin and think, damn, he seems like a good IT GUY, i should hire him....

i hope it's working...is it?


(Maybe making a web page resume to put in a web page that already has a resume pdf on it isn't the best idea, but then i also worked hard on my linkedin profile so everything on my resume is also visible on my public profile)
